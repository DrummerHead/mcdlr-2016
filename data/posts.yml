    I've always liked the pattern of having floated items in a fluid container. The elements adapt to the viewport's width and just "fall" when there's now enough space... but they do so rather ungracefully, leaving inconsistent white space on the sides.

    Responsive Thumbnails is the answer to this, giving these elements a percentage width based on the size of the element and the available space. Just go ahead and check it for yourself!

    Also, no dependency at all. No jQuery, no problem. And it's rather fast and efficient, dare I say!

    aprend.io is a Front-End course (only HTML &#38; CSS) in Spanish and for free, mainly composed of videos and reference code.

    This is the result of months of content creation, recording, video edition, uploading and site building. It's a way to return to the Internet what the internet has given me (knowledge, power and enjoyment).

This game opened up a whole new field of mathematical research, the field of [cellular automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata)

    I have always loved this game and thought that it was time to take a shot at recreating it, and that is what I did. Also, no java applet or any nonsense that I always see prompted when you want to play this game online. Profit!

    Another useful little tool, [filler text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_text) using [pangrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram). In general Lorem Ipsum is used as filler text, but why not Zoidberg? I mean&#8230; why not pangrams? They were created because they use each of the letters of the alphabet once, and that&#8217;s useful for testing typography. But it also generates a more homogenous visual texture.

    In most situations using filler text is bad, because you should know what your content is going to be before visually designing something. But sometimes you&#8217;re creating content architecture, and even thou you know the objectives of each area and the kinds of contents, you haven&#8217;t generated the content yet. I think that in these cases it&#8217;s alright to use filler text :)

    Inside you&#8217;ll find the code ready to be put on source, with paragraphs increasing in word count so you can choose the size that best suits your needs.

    Oh! And if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s the deal with the &#38;#8217; things, check this [handy utf-8 character reference](http://mcdlr.com/8/)

    Piet Mondrian painting, [De Stijl art movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl); rendered with HTML5 and CSS3, completely fluid and responsive.

    I&#8217;m only using js to adapt the height and width of the containing element to the viewport, but all the elements that comprise the actual painting are absolutely positioned with percentage values, making their positions relative to their containing element&#8217;s dimensions.

    With this project and DOMcraft I&#8217;ve found out that Firefox subpixel renderization is uncanny. In the other browsers you&#8217;ll notice gaps that will seldom show on Firefox. Try resizing the window of [De Stijl](/de-stijl) on different browsers to see what I mean.

    Oh! For comparison, you can [see the original painting](/de-stijl/mondrian.jpg). The colors are not exactly the same, but they are at their most &#8220;pure&#8221; RGB value, which follows De Stijl&#8217;s proposition of abstraction and simplicity.

    While it may seem this experiment makes use of Javascript, it does not :)

    This bookmarklet reloads only the CSS on your website. It assumes you are using jQuery and that you use a query to load newer styles (something like &#60;link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css?3"&#62;), it's ideal for Ruby on Rails apps.

    If you are only modifiying styles, it's quite faster than to reloading the whole page. Also, sometimes elements on page change via js and a page reload would take you back to another state, in that case this is the most useful case scenario. Actually I had to creat this to be able to adapt an ajax wizard to mobile.

    &#8220;scannato&#8221; is the name of this dynamic jQuery gallery. It works by generating links to images who's name follow a numeric progression.

    For instance, if you find an image at &#8220;http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car020.jpg&#8221; you can feed scannato with &#8220;http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car&#8221; for the url field; &#8220;1&#8221; for the starting n&deg; field; &#8220;50&#8221; for the ending n&deg; field; &#8220;3&#8221; for the padding zeroes field and leave &#8220;.jpg&#8221; as the format. Then, by pressing the &#8220;do it&#8221; button, a gallery will be generated with all the images ranging from &#8220;http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car001.jpg&#8221; to &#8220;http://www.somewhere.com/pics/car050.jpg&#8221;

    if the padding zeroes field is left empty, no padding zeroes will be put and the numbers will progress normally.

    This may sound link something pretty mundane, but is actually something I needed for work, since sometimes I save reference url in text files and need to access those urls later... and I don't like copy pasting things around when a smarter solution  is at hand :)
